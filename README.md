# MicroBuster3DPrinter
A small (mostly 3D Printed) 3D Printer

This is a small 3D Printer which I designed during the summer of 2018. The project's goal was to create a small, somewhat portable 3D printer.

There are many things which need to be improved for it to work as a functional machine, these include the reduction in size of components, fixing Z axis wobble, etc. 

Feel free to do as you wish with the machine, the machine is fully open source and easy to upgrade and modify. Use the CAD files provided to make any changes. 

To do:
-Fix some Z axis issues based on lenght of rods used for X axis. 

-Reduce the printing bed size.

-Create a proper BOM with all the vitamins used.
